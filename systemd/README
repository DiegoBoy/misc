init is here to clean zombies with waitpid()
if it fails to do that, zombies pile up and it becomes
impossible to stop and restart containers, for instance
it worked fine for years, until systemd came and failed
you had one job
to solve this, the clean-zombies.sh script attaches to
init and calls waitpid to all zombies

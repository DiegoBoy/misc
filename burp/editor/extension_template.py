"""Burp editor extension example.

The only thing you need to change is CHANGEME in the import line.

It creates a new tab in the proxy tab for some requests and responses, defined
by your criteria. In this tab, you define which text you want displayed. In the
repeater tab, you may edit that text, and the request will be rebuilt according
to your logic.

This design allows to minimize the amount of Python code interacting with Burp,
which runs the extension with Jython, and is slow to load, unload and debug.
By abstracting the interesting logic (present and edit requests) in a separate
Python module with no Burp dependency, you can add your own tests and develop
your extension faster.

Note Jython does not handle exceptions inside callbacks so try/except will not
work. Exceptions will be propagated to Java which then shows a Java stack trace
with no Python information, so you do not know where it was raised. Develop
your module so that there are no exceptions by checking for errors before.

Another interesting fact: calls from Python to Java are slow, so by putting
the parsing logic in a separate library rather than using some of the helpers
methods exposed by burp, it is noticeably faster.
